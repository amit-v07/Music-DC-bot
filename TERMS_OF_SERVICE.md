# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** February 9, 2026

By inviting and using the **Music Bot** (the "Service"), you agree to these Terms of Service.

## 1. Usage Agreement

### 1.1 Acceptance
Use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of these Terms. If you do not agree, you must remove the Service from your Discord server.

### 1.2 License to Use
You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the Service for its intended purpose (playing music in Discord voice channels).

### 1.3 Prohibited Activities
You agree not to:
- Use the Service for any illegal purposes.
- Exploit bugs or vulnerabilities (please report them instead!).
- Spam commands or intentionally overload the Service.
- Use the Service to stream content that violates Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.

## 2. Data & Privacy

### 2.1 Data Collection
We collect minimal data necessary for functionality:
- **Discord User & Server IDs**: To track settings, queues, and permissions.
- **Listening History**: We temporarily store titles of songs played to provide recommendations (Autoplay). This data is stored locally and is not shared with third parties.

### 2.2 Data Persistence
The Service does not use a permanent database. Most data (queues, volume settings) is cleared when the bot restarts or leaves a voice channel.

## 3. Availability & Warranty

### 3.1 "As Is" Basis
The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee 100% uptime or error-free operation.

### 3.2 Third-Party Services
The Service relies on third-party platforms (YouTube, Spotify, Discord). We are not responsible for issues caused by changes or outages in these services.

### 3.3 Right to Terminate
We reserve the right to ban any user or server from using the Service at any time, for any reason, without notice.

## 4. Updates
We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
